Current status: 

I am getting an issue where my return values are 2 points when it should be an area, additionally, neither point is close to the node I am trying to localize. 
To assit, I have made simple graphics 
next, I am going to try to figure out why the return value is two points. That seems like the easiest problem to tackle, I just need to run the algorthim until I see my mistake
